When you first run this system, you will notice a blue circle on the screen. To begin recording your gesture, your index finger must first enter this blue circle.

After performing your gesture, put down your index finger and raise your pinky finger (I know we discussed a fist but I faced a few issues with it so using pinky as a placeholder). It must be up for 2 seconds (the system counts this for you and shows you how many seconds it's been up for) for the system to terminate.


(This is my main issue)
After the system terminates, the last line in the console output will tell you which shape or stroke (see below) is closest to the gesture you performed and a second frame pops up showing the best gesture match and your normalized gesture.

If at any time you wish to quit the program early, press the 'q' button and it will terminate.
